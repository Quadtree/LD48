# Game Ideas

## Spelunky-Type Roguelike

## Underground Colony Sim

## FTL-Like Roguelike
* Worker placement where crewmembers make systems more efficient, but increase their power if they're assigned to them
* Trying to rescue a science ship lost in a nebula or something

## Freelancer-Like Roguelike
* Similar concept, you're going deeper and deeper into a nebula
* Maybe trying to resuce a missing ship?
  * This would turn it into a sort of race against time

* Probably best to have like points the player jumps to
* Some have beacons that were left by the ship you're following
* Some have something else?
  * Audiologs?
  * Power ups?
    * Like say a shield that protects you from the RED JUMP POINTS
    * Or something that makes your shield tougher vs some of the enemies
    *
  * Scientific clues?
* Sometimes there is no beacon and you have to guess

You're exploring a colorful cloud. The strategy is based on finding new colors. Eventually you reach the center, which is purple.

You follow a series of beacons (perhaps some are missing).

* GREY: No enemies, some asteroids
* YELLOW: Basic enemies, no asteroids
* RED: Tough enemies, constant damage
* TEAL: Basic enemies, sensors do not work
* PURPLE: No enemies, but a boss!

The problem here is that rendering a cloud for the player to fly through would ... not be easy. Perhaps some kind of asteroid field?

Perhaps make the cloud more of a background and less of fog. That way it doesn't seem so odd that it's mostly uniform.

## Done
* Pause game when cursor leaves viewport
* Basic weapon firing
* Particles passing the ship
* Some kind of enemy
* Background fog, various zones
* Marker on objective

## TODO
* Zone 2: Some squid enemies
* Zone 3: More squid enemies, and a DOT
* Zone 4: Objective & boss
* Markers on offscreen enemies
* Missiles
* Some kind of radar
* Title screen
* Final boss fight
* Victory screen
* Sound
* Music
